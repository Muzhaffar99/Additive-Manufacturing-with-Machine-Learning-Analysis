# Additive Manufacturing with Machine Learning Analysis

As a cutting-edge technique, surrogate modelling is widely used in a variety of fields, including physics, engineering, and biology. Surrogate modelling can approximate complex nonlinear systems or processes with simplified mathematical models. As a result,
surrogate models provide a computationally efficient way of exploring the behaviour of complex nonlinear systems, optimising design parameters, and making predictions without the need for performing computationally expensive simulations or experiments. 
In this project, the most accurate and computationally fast surrogate model is to be generated using appropriate machine learning methods to infer thermodynamic and mobility data for fast diffusion of the metallic alloys during the additive manufacturing process.
